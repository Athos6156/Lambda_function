# Lambda_function

Create a Lambda funtion on AWS >> Lambda

Copy Testing.json and paste it to configure test case.

You might need to change it to your own verfied email.

I have not hooked it with our micro service yet, but the event who trigger the function can be a just simple payment info .json.
